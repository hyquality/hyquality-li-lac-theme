            "text": "<p>Li-Lac Chocolates should be stored in a cool, dry room at temperatures between 55-68 degrees, avoiding heat, sunlight, moisture, humidity, and ambient odors. At lower temperatures, chocolate may collect condensation which can accelerate the appearance of fat bloom. At warmer temperatures, chocolate can tend to soften and lose its gloss. Do not refrigerate as this can cause sugar bloom on the surface. If you live in a warm area and do not have air conditioning, you can place chocolate in a refrigerator by wrapping it in a dry kitchen towel to minimize humidity and odor absorption.<\/p>"

            "text": "<p>There are two types of bloom common to chocolate: Fat Bloom and Sugar Bloom. Fat bloom can result when chocolate is exposed to fluctuating temperatures, producing a visible dull white film at the surface. Sugar bloom is a hard white surface film resulting from exposure to moisture formed by the dissolution and subsequent crystallization of sugar on the chocolate's surface. While fat bloom and sugar bloom affect the appearance of chocolate, the product remains perfectly safe to eat.<\/p>"
